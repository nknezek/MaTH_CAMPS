## Mantle Convection

MaTH-CAMPS

* 1D parameterized convection based on Stevenson 1983. 
* Canonical model with single-layer mantle
* hypothesis mantles with dense basal mantle layer
* adiabatic gradient through the mantle 
  * q_cmb heat flow set by TBL gradient at base of mantle
  * T_cmb set by core, given at q_cmb
* surface temperature constant, no atmosphere
* mantle melt production within mantle and migration tracked and properly accounted for in thermal model
