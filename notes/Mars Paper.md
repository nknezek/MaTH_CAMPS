# Mars Paper

### GRL 

* 4 figures

### Outline 

Thesis: Basal mantle layer proposal can explain many weird observations such as early dynamo cessation and continued mantle melt to geologic present day.

secondary observations

* mass, MOI / at least partially molten core


* Reversed heat flow into core due to basal mantle layer

### Figures

#### Main text

1. # Conceptual layout 

   1. pie slice about the layer / chemistry / rationale of the models
   2. solidus and liquidus of mantle
   3. geochem basics of paper
2. Model results v time
   1. a) cold, b) hot, c) no layer
      1. cold start layer
         1. partial magma ocean
      2. hot start layer
         1. full magma ocean
      3. no layer
         1. 
   2. Heat flux, melt
3. Mass, MOI

Other Ideas

1. Vs/Vp with depth? 
2. Fe-S phase diagrams?
3. Dynamo power?
