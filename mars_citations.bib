  abstract = {Abstract The rate at which heat is extracted across the core mantle boundary (CMB) is constrained by the requirement of dynamo action in the core. This constraint can be computed explicitly using the entropy balance of the core and depends on the thermal conductivity, whose value has been revised upwardly. A high order model (fourth degree polynomial of the radial position) for the core structure is derived and the implications for the core cooling rate and thermal evolution obtained, using the recent values of the thermal conductivity. For a thermal conductivity increasing with depth as proposed by some of these recent studies, a CMB heat flow equal to the isentropic value (13.25 TW at present) leads to a 700 km thick layer at the top of the core where a downward convective heat flow is necessary to maintain an isentropic and well mixed average state. Considering a CMB heat flow larger than the well mixed isentropic value leads to an inner core less than 700 Myr old and the thermal evolution of the core is largely constrained by the conditions for dynamo action without an inner core. Analytical calculations for that period show that a CMB temperature larger than 7000 K must have prevailed 4.5 Gyr ago if the geodynamo has been driven by thermal convection for that whole time. This raises questions regarding the onset of the geodynamo and its continuous operation for the last 3.5 Gyr. Implications regarding the evolution of a basal magma ocean are also considered.},

  abstract = {The Earth acts as a gigantic heat engine driven by the decay of radiogenic isotopes and slow cooling, which gives rise to plate tectonics, volcanoes and mountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and freezing (as the solid inner core grows), and on chemical convection (due to light elements expelled from the liquid on freezing). The power supplied to the geodynamo, measured by the heat flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB), places constraints on Earth's evolution. Estimates of CMB heat flux depend on properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent experimental and theoretical difficulties. Here we use density functional theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core conditions from first principles--unlike previous estimates, which relied on extrapolations. The mixtures of iron, oxygen, sulphur and silicon are taken from earlier work and fit the seismologically determined core density and inner-core boundary density jump. We find both conductivities to be two to three times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core thermal histories and power requirements need to be reassessed. New estimates indicate that the adiabatic heat flux is 15 to 16 terawatts at the CMB, higher than present estimates of CMB heat flux based on mantle convection; the top of the core must be thermally stratified and any convection in the upper core must be driven by chemical convection against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow. Power for the geodynamo is greatly restricted, and future models of mantle evolution will need to incorporate a high CMB heat flux and explain the recent formation of the inner core.},

  abstract = {Of the terrestrial planets, Earth and probably Mercury possess substantial intrinsic magnetic fields generated by core dynamos, while Venus and Mars apparently lack such fields. Thermal histories are calculated for these planets and are found to admit several possible present states, including those which suggest simple explanations for the observations; whule the cores of Earth and Mercury are continuing to freeze, the cores of Venus and Mars may still be completely liquid. The models assume whole mantle convection, which is parameterized by a simple Nusselt-Rayleigh number relation and dictates the rate at which heat escapes from the core. It is found that completely fluid cores, devoid of intrinsic heat sources, are not likely to sustain thermal convection for the age of the solar system but cool to a subadiabatic, conductive state that can not maintain a dynamo. Planets which nucleate an inner core continue to sustain a dynamo because of the gravitational energy release and chemically driven convection that accompany inner core growth. The absence of a significant inner core can arise in Venus because of its slightly higher temperature and lower central pressure relative to Earth, while a Martian core avoids the onset of freezing if the abundance of sulfur in the core is $\gtrapprox$15\% by mass. All of the models presented assume that (
I) core dynamos are driven by thermal and/or chemical convection; (
ii) radiogenic heat production is confined to the mantle; (
iii) mantle and core cool from initially hot states which are at the solidus and superliquidus, respectively; and (
iv) any inner core excludes the light alloying material (sulfur or oxygen) which then mixes uniformly upward through the outer core. The models include realistic pressure and composition-dependent freezing curves for the core, and material parameters are chosen so that the correct present-day values of heat outflow, upper mantle temperature and viscosity, and inner core radius are obtained for the earth. It is found that Venus and Mars may have once had dynamos maintained by thermal convection alone. Earth may have had a completely fluid core and a dynamo maintained by thermal convection for the first 2 to 3 by, but an inner core nucleates and the dynamo energetics are subsequently dominated by gravitational energy release. Complete freezing of the Mercurian core is prohibited if it contains even a small amount of sulfur, and a dynamo can be maintained by chemical convection in a thin, fluid shell.},

  title = {Thermal and {{Compositional Evolution}} of the {{Core}}},
  volume = {9},
  abstract = {This chapter examines the thermal and compositional evolution of the Earth's core, from shortly after its formation to the present day. The initial state and composition of the core were determined mainly by the manner in which the Earth accreted. The initial core temperature was probably high enough to produce lower-mantle melting. The light element composition of the core remains uncertain; O and S are the most likely culprits, though Si, H, or C might also be present. The present-day core geodynamo is maintained primarily by compositional convection as the inner core solidifies. The core-mantle boundary (CMB) heat flux is estimated at 10. ??. 4. TW and is sufficient to drive a dynamo dissipating 1-5. TW.The evolution of the core to its present-day state involved two events of importance: the initiation of the geodynamo and the onset of inner core formation. Geodynamo activity started at 3.5. Gyr. BP at the latest, and could have been sustained without an inner core being present. Theoretical estimates suggest that the inner core probably formed at ???1. Gyr. BP, unless either significant quantities of potassium were present in the core, or both the ohmic dissipation ($\backslash$textless0.25. TW) and the CMB heat flow ($\backslash$textless4. TW) were very low. The Re-Os-Pt isotopic system has been used to infer that inner-core solidification started by 3.5. Gyr. BP, but this hypothesis remains highly controversial.For a moderately dissipative dynamo, the change in core temperature over 4. Gy was probably 200-800. K, implying an early lower mantle that was extensively molten. The CMB heat flux probably evolved in two stages: an early, high heat flux stage, due to the melting of the lower mantle, and potentially generating very strong magnetic fields; and a later, lower heat flux stage.Several areas require further study. There is a discrepancy between estimates of the inner core age based on Os isotope systematics and those based on thermal evolution models. Neither cosmochemical nor geophysical arguments have so far resolved whether the core contains significant potassium. The evolution of the CMB heat flux over time is currently poorly understood, particularly the effect of lower-mantle melting. Several material parameters, particularly the thermal conductivity of iron under core conditions, need to be better known. Finally, future paleomagnetic measurements may help to provide further observational constraints on the evolution of the geodynamo, and thus the thermal evolution of the core. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Mars is believed to have possessed a dynamo that ceased operating approximately 4 Ga ago, although the exact time is still under debate. The scope of this study is to constrain the possible timing of its cessation by studying the magnetization signatures of craters. The study uses the latest available model of the lithospheric magnetic field of Mars, which is based on Mars Global Surveyor data. We tackle the problem of nonuniqueness that characterizes the inversion of magnetic field data for the magnetization by inferring only the visible part of the magnetization, that is, the part of the magnetization that gives rise to the observed magnetic field. Further on, we demonstrate that a zero visible magnetization is a valid proxy for the entire magnetization being zero under the assumption of a magnetization distribution of induced geometry. This assumption holds for craters whose thermoremanent magnetization has not been significantly altered since its acquisition. Our results show that the dynamo shut off after the impacts that created the Acidalia and SE Elysium basins and before the crust within the Utopia basin cooled below its magnetic blocking temperature. Accounting for the age uncertainties in the dating of these craters, we estimate that the dynamo shut off at an N(300) crater retention age of 2.5\textendash{}3.2 or an absolute model age of 4.12\textendash{}4.14 Ga. Moreover, the Martian dynamo may have been weaker in its early stage, which if true implies that the driving mechanism of the Martian dynamo was not the same throughout its history.},

This map compares favorably to sparsely sampled dayside MAG data taken at similar altitudes, insofar as a direct comparison is meaningful. Using this map, we present two case studies. The first compares the magnetic signatures of two highland volcanoes, concluding that the comparatively greater thermal demagnetization at Syrtis Major compared with Tyrrhena Patera is likely due to a higher ratio of intruded to extruded magmas. The second uses the map along with topographic data to compare the magnetic signatures and crater retention ages of the demagnetized Hellas impact basin and magnetized Ladon impact basin. From this comparison, we determine that the martian global dynamo magnetic field went from substantial to very weak or nonexistent in the absolute model age time interval 4.15 $\pm$ 0.05 to 4.07 $\pm$ 0.05 Ga ago.},

  abstract = {Viking mission image data revealed the total spatial extent of preserved volcanic surface on Mars. One of the dominating surface expressions is Olympus Mons and the surrounding volcanic province Tharsis. Earlier studies of the global volcanic sequence of events based on stratigraphic relationships and crater count statistics were limited to the image resolution of the Viking orbiter camera. Here, a global investigation based on high-resolution image data gathered by the High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) during the first years of Mars Express orbiting around Mars is presented. Additionally, Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) images were used for more detailed and complementary information. The results reveal global volcanism during the Noachian period ($>$3.7 Ga) followed by more focused vent volcanism in three (Tharsis, Elysium, and Circum-Hellas) and later two (Tharsis and Elysium) volcanic provinces. Finally, the volcanic activity became localized to the Tharsis region (about 1.6 Ga ago), where volcanism was active until very recently (200\textendash{}100 Ma). These age results were expected from radiometric dating of martian meteorites but now verified for extended geological units, mainly found in the Tharsis Montes surroundings, showing prolonged volcanism for more than 3.5 billions years. The volcanic activity on Mars appears episodic, but decaying in intensity and localizing in space. The spatial and temporal extent of martian volcanism based on crater count statistics now provides a much better database for modelling the thermodynamic evolution of Mars.},

  abstract = {Abstract\textemdash{} Crystallization of a magma ocean on a large terrestrial planet that is significantly melted by the energy of accretion may lead to an unstable cumulate density stratification, which may overturn to a stable configuration. Overturn of the initially unstable stratification may produce an early basaltic crust and differentiated mantle reservoirs. Such a stable compositional stratification can have important implications for the planet's subsequent evolution by delaying or suppressing thermal convection and by influencing the distribution of radiogenic heat sources. We use simple models for fractional crystallization of a martian magma ocean, and calculate the densities of the resulting cumulates. While the simple models presented do not include all relevant physical processes, they are able to describe to first order a number of aspects of martian evolution. The models describe the creation of magma source regions that differentiated early in the history of Mars, and present the possibility of an early, brief magnetic field initiated by cold overturned cumulates falling to the coremantle boundary. In a model that includes the density inversion at about 7.5 GPa, where olivine and pyroxene float in the remaining magma ocean liquids while garnet sinks, cumulate overturn sequesters alumina in the deep martian interior. The ages and compositions of source regions are consistent with SNC meteorite data.},

  abstract = {Mare volcanics consist of basalts and picritic pyroclastic glasses spanning a wide range of TiOz concentration. The more primitive low-Ti basalts and picritic glasses have olivine alone on their lowpressure liquidi. Most of the chemical variation among the low-Ti basalts is the result of olivine fractionation in a series of parental MgO-rich liquids differing in TiO2 concentration. With one possible exception (Apollo 17 VLT) none of the picritic compositions is a suitable parent for any of the observed low-Ti basalts. Most of the chemical variation among the high-Ti basalts is the result of a series of magmas fractionated along the low-pressure olivine + armalcolite/ilmenite cotectic. All of the picritic high-Ti glasses have olivine alone on the liquidus, but none is a suitable parent for any of the basalts. Volcanics with intermediate Ti02 concentrations (5 to 10 wt\% ) are widespread in the maria, even though they are not well represented in the sample collections; however, there is no evidence either among the samples or from remote sensing studies of basalts with $>$ 13 wt\% TiO2 that would be expected as differentiates of the picritic glasses with the highest Ti02 concentrations. Controlled-cooling-rate crystallization studies on a variety of mare compositions have provided the basis for reconstructing the size and, in some cases, stratigraphy of mare flows. Groundmass textures, crystal size, crystal morphology, nucleation density, and zoning patterns have all been employed to quantify cooling histories of mare basal\& A single-stage linear cooling rate may produce a porphrytic texture. Rapid cooling may also cause plagioclase to crystallize after a mineral that it precedes during slow cooling. Mare basalts are highly reduced. Mineral assemblages and intrinsic oxygen fugacity measurements indicate fs below the wtistite-iron buffer and at or near iron metal saturation. Accordingly, experiments run in high-purity iron capsules gained or lost little iron. Most basalts are undersaturated with respect to sulphur, so reduction through sulphur volatilization cannot be invoked to explain the presence of iron in olivine phenocrysts. The low oxidation state is most likely the result of melting a reduced interior under fluid-absent conditions. The progressive reduction of Cr3+ --, Cr `+ and Ti4+ + Ti 3+in lunar melts permits the elimination of the Fe3+ that is present at iron-saturation in simple systems. Crystal-liquid partition coefficients determined from melting experiments have been used in a wide range of calculations of major and trace element evolution. The coefficient for Fe-Mg exchange between olivine and liquid apparently varies with TiOl concentration of the liquid and is particularly useful in assessing whether fine-g\&red rocks have excess olivine. Nb and Ti have excess concentrations in mare basalts relative to adjacent REE in incompatibility diagrams. These excesses or positive anomalies are consistent with ilmenite accumulation in light of measured partition coefficients and imply continuous variation of accumulated ilmenite even in the low-Ti mare source regions. Pressures of multiple saturation (olivine + pyroxene + Cr-rich spine1 + ilmenite) are in the range of 5 to 12.5 kbar for primitive mare basalts and in the range of 18 to 25 kbar for the picritic glasses. LowCa pyroxene is the only pyroxene along the liquidus of the low-Ti basalts and glasses; however, augite is the pyroxene most commonly observed along the high-pressure liquidi of the high-Ti basalts: High-Ti picrites have augite in the subliquidus region at intermediate pressures where olivine is the liquidus phase, but orthopyroxene is the liquidus phase at multiple saturation. Because of the steep depth/pressure gradient in the outer portion of the Moon (20 km/ kbar), these pressures imply: (a) great depths of melting within the Moon and (b) some means of transporting magmas hundreds of kilometers to the surface without significant chemical modification, if both olivine and pyroxene were left in the residuum.},
